*      Deviant behaviour is a global concern. In this study, the deviant behaviour among youths in Lagos state was investigated. The objectives are to determine and compare the rate, investigate the pattern, establish the factors that cause deviance, check for prevalent deviance, develop statistical model for the prediction of prevalent deviant behaviour among youths in Lagos state, suggest possible ways to curb deviant behaviour in the state and make recommendations based on the findings. Questionnaires were administered among youths in secondary schools, tertiary institutions, and those on the street.* 

# Population Size 
*        A sample size of five hundred respondents of ages ranging 11-30 years was investigated for this study. Descriptive statistics and structural equation modelling as well as logistic regression were used to analyse the data obtained from sixteen local government areas of Lagos State. The results showed that over 60% of the youths in Lagos have one form of deviant behaviour or the other. It was also observed that deviant behaviours are more pronounced among males than their female counterparts and among 18-25 years age bracket. Deviant behaviour for secondary, tertiary and youths on the street were compared. Pilfering is more common among secondary school students compared with tertiary and youths on the street while pornography and casual sex are prevalent among youths in tertiary institution and on the street.  Although majority of the youths appear to be involved in foul language, this is more pronounced among the youths in tertiary institutions followed by those on the streets and least among secondary school students. Significant proportion of Lagos state youths are given to foul language, pilfering, pornography and casual sex. These are the prevalent deviant behaviours in Lagos State.

# Model Applied
Logistic regression was employed to predict these prevalent behaviours. *

# Accuracy Rate
* The models were observed to perform up to 88% accuracy level, based on the percentage accuracy from the confusion matrix. The logistic regression analyses show that deviant behaviours among Lagos state youths can be traced to poor parenting, bad associations, negative labelling and financial and educational strain. The government, community, religious organization and parents in curbing deviant behaviours. *
